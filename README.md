# Scepter Œ¥-me13

> _‚ÄúA thousand mirrors, one reflection.‚Äù_  
> _A synchronized experiment in time, memory, and motion._

## üß© Overview

**Scepter Œ¥-me13** is a fan-made, synchronized visual project built with **React**.  
It continuously loops a preloaded video file across 100 live canvas instances ‚Äî all synchronized by global time, creating a grid of parallel reflections.  

The system uses:

- Frame-accurate synchronization across devices via real-time timestamps  
- 100 mirrored video instances rendered to `<canvas>` with subtle tinting  
- A smooth Unicode spinner animation for system feedback  
- A real-time progress and cycle tracker  
- Volume and mute control, while restricting all playback manipulation

The entire loop is autonomous ‚Äî users can‚Äôt skip, pause, or rewind.  
It‚Äôs an homage to continuity, impermanence, and visual rhythm.

## üåê Deployment

Phainon Shrine is built for static hosting (e.g. Vercel, Netlify).
The synchronization will automatically align regardless of timezone ‚Äî
since the core logic relies on UTC timestamps, not local system time.
