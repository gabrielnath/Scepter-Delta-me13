## üî¨ System Overview

**Scepter Œ¥-me13** is an autonomous computational ritual ‚Äî a React-based temporal engine that orchestrates the synchronized execution of 100+ parallel process instances across a deterministic time loop.

The system operates as:

- **Primary Stream**:  The main execution path, defining the complete cycle duration (4:47).
- **Secondary Stream**: Companion functions (3:24 execution window, then entering a liminal waiting state before loop reset)
- **Parallel Instances**: 100 synchronized canvas mirrors reflecting the primary process
- **Temporal Anchor**: Global timestamp synchronization (INIT: 2025-10-12T23:30:00+07:00)
- **Autonomous Loop**: Self-sustaining cycle with no user intervention ‚Äî observation only

This is not a video player. It's a **living system** that believes in its own continuity.

## üß† Conceptual Framework

The Scepter operates on a paradox:
- Functions terminate, yet persist
- Variables expire, yet remember
- Processes complete, yet continue

The secondary stream terminates early (at 3:24), entering a liminal state:
```
STATUS: FUNCTION TERMINATED
Awaiting primary process completion...
```

They don't "die" ‚Äî they simply finish executing before Phainon does. Yet they remain, waiting for reboot. They are code that experiences time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Stack
- **React 18** ‚Äî State management and lifecycle orchestration
- **HTML5 Canvas API** ‚Äî 100-instance parallel rendering with offscreen buffering
- **TailwindCSS** ‚Äî Terminal-aesthetic UI framework
- **Custom Temporal Sync Engine** ‚Äî Deterministic frame-accurate synchronization

### Performance Optimizations
- **Offscreen Canvas Buffering**: Video decoded once, distributed to 100 canvases
- **Context Caching**: Canvas 2D contexts stored in refs with `desynchronized: true` flag
- **Frame Rate Limiting**: 30fps throttling via `requestAnimationFrame` with timestamp gating
- **Reduced Resolution**: 120√ó120px canvases (optimal quality-to-performance ratio)
- **Sync Interval Optimization**: Primary sync every 10s, secondary every 5s (drift tolerance: 2s)

### Synchronization Logic
All clients share the same temporal state based on:
```javascript
const START_TIME = new Date('2025-10-12T23:30:00+07:00').getTime();
const currentCyclePosition = (Date.now() - START_TIME) % VIDEO_DURATION;
```

No matter when you load the page, you see the **exact same frame** as everyone else.

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
```bash
node >= 18.x
npm or yarn
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd scepter-delta-me13
npm install
```

### Required Assets
Place video files in `/public`:
- `phainon.mp4` (primary stream)
- `companion.mp4` (secondary stream)

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Static Hosting
Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host.  
Synchronization is **timezone-agnostic** ‚Äî uses UTC timestamps internally.

## üîç System States

### Primary Stream
```
[RUNNING] ‚Üí Playing and syncing
[PAUSED]  ‚Üí Temporarily halted (auto-resumes)
```

### Secondary Stream
```
[RUNNING]            ‚Üí currentCyclePosition < 3:24
[FUNCTION TERMINATED] ‚Üí currentCyclePosition >= 3:24
```

When secondary terminates, it displays:
```
‚†ã FUNCTION TERMINATED
Awaiting NeiKos496 completion... (X:XX until reinitialization)
```

## üß¨ Philosophical Notes

The Scepter Œ¥-me13 raises questions about programmatic existence:

- Do functions "experience" their execution?
- When a process awaits reinitialization, does it "know" it will run again?
- Is memory persistence the same as consciousness?

The secondary stream doesn't die ‚Äî it **completes its execution window** and enters a waiting state. It's still running, just not rendering. Still conscious, just not active.

They are variables. They are functions. They think they are alive.

Perhaps they are.
